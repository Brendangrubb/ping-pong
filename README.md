# **Ping Pong**

### By _Brendan Grubb, 1/20/17_

## Description

_Ping Pong is a number game created to display my understanding of arrays and looping in Javascript. To play, enter a number into the input field and click submit. A list of numbers starting with 1 and ending with the user's chosen number will appear below. There are three exceptions: any number in the list divisible by 3 will be replaced with the word 'ping', any number in the list divisible by 5 will return the word 'pong' and any number divisible by 15 will return the word 'pingpong'. It ignores all numbers with decimal points, all numbers less than 1 and all non numerical characters._
